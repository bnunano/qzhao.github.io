<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

From 2010 to now, I am an assistant professor in the School of Nuclear and Engineering at North China Electric Power University in Beijing, China. In 2014.10-2014.12, I was a visiting scholar in the Goethe University following the implementation plan for the Marie Curie People International Research Staff Exchange program invited by Prof. Dr. Andrey Solov’yov.

My interests are in nuclear science and nanoscience including: fission and fusion reactor materials; neutron and charged particle radiation effects in materials; microdosimetry; graphene; fullerene. The objective is to explain and predict the properties of materials using first-principles theories, molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo methods and computation. I have published more than 50 papers with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AT3JRp8AAAAJ&hl=en'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AT3JRp8AAAAJ&hl=en'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
